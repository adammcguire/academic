As a researcher, I am broadly interested in applying positive psychology and acceptance-based principles to treating moral injury and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in veterans. I am curious about the factors influencing well-being after morally injurious event exposure, particularly the complex interplay between posttraumatic growth and positive psychology constructs (i.e., moral elevation, meaning, and gratitude). A secondary research interest pertains to assessing, preventing, and treating moral injury among refugees and foreign aid workers.
