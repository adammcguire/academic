Serving in the Marine Corps gave insight to my research interests of delving into the Veteran population, fitting the pieces together of how veterans transition back into society, and the causes leading them to depression and anxiety. PTSD is another condition I would like to study by using Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and integrative exercise to combat its effects on veterans.
