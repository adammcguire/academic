My research interests broadly pertain to trauma, PTSD, and moral injury, particularly in veteran populations. I am interested in how traumatic events shape how we relate to the world and those around us, how and why trauma responses differ from person to person, and how violence is perpetuated. I am currently studying how third-wave therapy interventions can effectively treat and spark resilience in individuals suffering from PTSD and the effects of trauma.
