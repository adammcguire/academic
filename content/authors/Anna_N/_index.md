My research interests primarily relate to the development and expression of post-traumatic stress disorder in adolescents and adults. I am particularly interested in the development and expression of complex-post traumatic stress disorder, and in the efficacy of positive psychology treatment methods for complex forms of trauma. My research background relates to the effects of shame on learning, and I am interested in exploring how shame and guilt impact oneâ€™s ability to recover from trauma.
