My research interests center around examining social factors that contribute to the onset and maintenance of substance use disorder (SUD), and substance use recovery (SUR). Specifically, I am interested in examining the different models of SUR and how they influence the individualâ€™s personal wellbeing. Additionally, I have an interest in working with veterans who experience comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and SUD. Outside of research, I am passionate about helping underrepresented students gain access to academic opportunities in the field of psychology.
