My research interests include improving mental health treatments for underserved populations and exploring how to better identify the dimensions of traumatic adversity and victimization. I am particularly interested in the assessment of trauma in polyvictim, underserved populations to develop multifaceted interventions that can address the various types of victimization and more effectively treat and recover from trauma.
