My research interests include anxiety disorders and social isolation. Regarding anxiety disorders, I am interested in the environmental predictors of anxiety in children and adults as well as the neuroscientific effects of those predictors. Within social isolation I am interested in creating a better framework to measure the severity of social isolation, and its effects, and applying that framework to understand predicting factors such as socio-economic status and family dysfunction.
