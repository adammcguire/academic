In our efforts to integrate positive psychology into mental health treatment for veterans, we focus on several areas of study.

- **Improving understanding of prosocial emotions**
  - Moral elevation: feeling inspired or uplifted after witnessing someone perform a virtuous act
  - Gratitude: acknowledging and expressing thanks for benefits experienced
- **Investigating these emotions in experimental settings**
  - Can we elicit positive, prosocial emotions in veterans with signfiicant PTSD?
  - What are the immediate and delayed effects of exposure to these emotions?
- **Examining natural occurrences of positive experiences/emotions**
  - When are people most likely to experience moral elevation or gratitude?
  - When might this occur in veterans, specifically?
  - What are the innate, demographic, and contextual predictors of experiencing these emotions?
- **Treatment development**
  - Can we develop interventions that incorporate these principles, while remaining feasible and acceptable for veterans?
  - Can we add these principles as supplments to enhance existing interventions and treatments?
