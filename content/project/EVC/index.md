**Purpose**: 
The purpose of this study is to identify videos that demonstrate others' virtuous behavior and thus, elicit state-level moral elevation. This study aims to develop a catalog of such videos, and to investigate the features of videos that might play a role in perceiving virtue and triggering an emotional response. Specifically, selected videos will be coded for virtues/values demonstrated, demographic information regarding the target moral exemplar, and categorizing specific behaviors highlighted in the video. This study also aims to create a future resource by developing a set of validated videos that can be easily used by other researchers and potentially clinicians/patients interested in piloting the possible therapeutic effects of elevation.
