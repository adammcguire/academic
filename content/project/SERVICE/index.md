## **SERVICE**: **S**tudying **E**ffects of **R**eturning **V**eterans **I**nvolved in **C**ommunity **E**ngagement

**Purpose**: 
The purpose of the study is to examine the longitudinal relationship between veteran engagement in community outreach/disaster relief and mental health outcomes.  The study will also examine potential mechanisms (e.g. moral elevation, social connection) between veteran engagement in community outreach/disaster relief and mental health outcomes. 

**Background**: 
Volunteering is related to improved health and well-being in civilians and older adults. Volunteer organizations that handle disasters are crucial to their communities, more so in the immediate hours after a disaster. When volunteers go into disaster zones, they experience a side of life that is strikingly heartbreaking; this may stimulate emotional responses to continue helping those affected by disasters (Ai et al., 2011). Quevillon et al. (2016) found that when volunteers are educated and prepared prior to entering a disaster zone, they are able to implement self-care strategies that promote growth and increased self-efficacy. Conversely, lack of preparedness and support may lead to greater vulnerability to psychopathological disorders (Thormar et al., 2013). 
 
One group that may be an underrepresented resource to communities and scarcely studied in conjunction with volunteer work are military veterans. Der-Martirosian et al. (2019) found that many veterans possess characteristics that would be valuable during disaster response, such as being action oriented, self-sufficient, prepared, able to stay calm during times of crisis, highly flexible and adaptable. Indeed, many veterans actively seek opportunities to continue giving back to the community after their military service (Kranke et al., 2017). Yet, for the veteran, how does participation in volunteer and disaster relief impact their mental health. Lawrence et al. (2017) found, among veterans with a history of TBI, significant changes for perceived overall health and with regard to decreased PTSD symptoms, increased perceived self-efficacy, decreased feelings of isolation and loneliness, and increased availability of social support. The impacts of participating in a community-based volunteering program on returning military veterans have scarcely been studied. Thus, the purpose of the study is to examine the longitudinal relationship between veteran engagement in community outreach/disaster relief and mental health outcomes. The study will also examine potential mechanisms (e.g. moral elevation, social connection) between veteran engagement in community outreach/disaster relief and mental health outcomes.
