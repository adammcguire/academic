abstract: Laboratory studies suggest that witnessing virtuous acts triggers moral
  elevation, an emotion characterized by feeling uplifted and increased prosocial
  motives. However, it remains unknown whether regular inductions can increase elevation
  and prosocial motives in daily life without being vulnerable to habituation or adaptation
  effects. Participants (total N = 181) were randomly assigned to elevating vs. neutral
  or amusing inductions (video or recall tasks) for seven days (Study 1), ten days
  (Study 2), or 12 days over one month (Study 3). Multilevel growth models showed
  that relative to comparison conditions, elevation inductions increased daily elevation,
  positive affect, and prosocial outcomes (compassionate goals and affiliation), and
  decreased self-protective motives (self-image goals). Adaptation effects occurred
  for immediate responses when exercises occurred daily, but not when spaced out over
  time, and not for outcomes measured later each day. Results suggest benefits of
  brief, regular elevation experiences and have implications for interventions targeting
  specific emotions.
