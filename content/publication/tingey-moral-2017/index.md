abstract: After a mass shooting, community members may experience not only distress,
  but also feeling uplifted or morally elevated by others’ prosocial responses to
  the trauma. Those experiencing elevation may be more likely to strive to support
  others (compassionate goals) and to endorse posttraumatic growth (PTG). However,
  the role of elevation in PTG, and the relative contribution of compassionate goals
  (both from and toward others), remains unknown. Students, faculty, and staff (N
  = 385) completed measures four months after a campus shooting, and a subset repeated
  measures at eight months (n = 82). As expected, compassionate goals toward others
  incrementally predicted higher PTG beyond perceptions of compassionate goals from
  others. Also, elevation concurrently and prospectively predicted higher PTG. Lastly,
  elevation mediated effects of others’ compassionate goals on PTG, as hypothesized
  (95% CI = 2.59 to 5.43). These findings have implications for understanding the
  social and emotional processes that facilitate PTG.
