abstract: Servicemembers returning from recent conflicts frequently report symptoms
  associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI) and are subsequently assessed within
  the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical system. Information on potential
  cognitive and behavioral correlates of TBI is available from multiple sources. A
  Veteran’s symptom presentation may be significantly influenced by the information
  he or she has received. Despite knowledge of the relationship between information
  source and symptom presentation, little work has focused on a characterization of
  where Veterans receive their information. The present study aims to fill this gap
  in the literature. We asked 152 Veterans who screened positive for possible TBI
  within the VA healthcare system about the sources of information they have encountered
  regarding TBI and its sequelae. “Friends in the military” was the most frequently
  cited source of information, followed by the Internet, medical professionals, and
  informational pamphlets. The results of this survey indicate that Veterans are being
  exposed to information about TBI prior to a formal evaluation and that this information
  comes from multiple sources of varying reliability. Future research should focus
  on evaluating and ultimately improving the reliability of this information in order
  to positively influence the treatment of Veterans.
