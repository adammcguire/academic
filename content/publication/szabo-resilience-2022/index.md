abstract: '[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 14(S1)
  of Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy (see record 2022-45004-002).
  In the article (https://doi.org/10.1037/tra0001143), the Supplemental materials
  link was missing from the title page. All versions of this article have been corrected.]
  Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common problem for veterans.
  Resilience, the tendency to bounce back from difficult circumstances, is negatively
  associated with posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) among individuals with a history
  of trauma, and it may be important to understand responses to trauma reminders.
  Method: Using a quasi-experimental design, we examined the association between trait
  resilience and state PTCs in veterans with PTSD (n = 47, Mage = 48.60, 91.8% male)
  at two points: following a written trauma narrative exposure (Time 1 [T1]), and
  following a subsequent positive distraction task (i.e., brief, positive video; Time
  2 [T2]). Results: After controlling for PTSD symptom severity and combat exposure,
  resilience was negatively associated with PTCs at T1 (ΔR2 = .19) and T2 (ΔR2 = .13).
  However, resilience was a poor predictor of change in PTCs from T1 to T2. We also
  examined the relationship between resilience and subtypes of PTCs: resilience was
  associated with negative views of the self (T1, ΔR2 = .24) but not negative views
  of the world or self-blame (T1, ΔR2s ≤ .07); these results were consistent at T2.
  Conclusions: Thus, resilience may attenuate negative trauma-related cognitions after
  trauma recall; however, this study was not designed to test causal pathways. Future
  research could examine whether resilience-building exercises reduce negative PTCs
  after trauma reminders among veterans. Additional research is needed to generalize
  to other trauma-exposed populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all
