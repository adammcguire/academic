abstract: 'Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by strong negative
  emotions, often in response to trauma cues or reminders. Subsequent emotion regulation
  strategies impact the maintenance of PTSD symptoms and other trauma-related outcomes
  (depression, substance use). This study aimed to examine a range of trauma-cued
  emotions to enhance our understanding of changes following treatment and their potential
  role in improving relevant outcomes. Participants included 67 veterans diagnosed
  with PTSD and a substance use disorder who completed a dual diagnosis residential
  program that used cognitive processing therapy. At pre- and posttreatment, we measured
  8 negative emotions following a trauma recall and PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms,
  and negative urgency (impulsivity following negative emotions) as treatment outcomes.
  We used t-tests to assess changes at posttreatment and a within-subjects mediational
  analysis to test whether changes in trauma-cued emotions mediated treatment outcomes.
  Participants reported moderate, significant decreases for 5 emotions at posttreatment:
  anger at self, disgust at self, fear, guilt, and sadness (d â‰¥ 0.50), whereas nonsignificant
  changes were found for anger at others, disgust at others, and shame. Mediation
  analyses indicated greater reductions in trauma-cued sadness had a significant indirect
  effect on improvement in PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and negative urgency.
  Reductions in disgust at self and fear also demonstrated a significant indirect
  effect on depressive symptom improvement. In this dual diagnosis program, veterans
  reported a significant reduction in some, but not all, trauma-cued emotions, and
  improvements in only select emotions accounted for a significant portion of improvement
  in relevant treatment outcomes.'
