abstract: Dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions are important in the emergence and
  maintenance of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the modification of such
  cognitions is a proposed mechanism of trauma treatment. However, the authors are
  not aware of any research examining trauma-related cognitions as a treatment mechanism
  in a sample of individuals with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder (SUD).
  Accordingly, the present study sought to address this gap in the literature and
  examined the relationship between trauma-related cognitions and treatment outcomes
  within a sample of seventy-two veterans diagnosed with PTSD and SUD. Veterans completed
  a 6-week day CPT-based treatment program that included cognitive processing therapy
  as a central component. Measures of trauma-related cognitions, PTSD symptoms, depressive
  symptoms, and trauma-cued substance craving were completed at pre- and post-treatment.
  As expected, trauma-related cognitions were associated with several PTSD-related
  variables prior to treatment. Furthermore, results of a within-subjects mediational
  analysis indicated that maladaptive trauma-related cognitions decreased during the
  treatment program and accounted for a significant portion of the variance in the
  reduction of PTSD and depressive symptoms at post-treatment. This study provides
  support for the position that attempts to modify dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions
  among veterans with co-occurring PTSD and SUD can lead to desirable treatment outcomes.
