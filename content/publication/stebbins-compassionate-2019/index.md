abstract: 'Introduction: Social support is known to buffer posttraumatic stress disorder
  (PTSD) symptoms, but the stress-buffering properties of striving to help and support
  others (compassionate goals) have received less attention. Recent research suggests
  that compassionate goals shape social support processes and dampen stress responses
  following social threat, but their relevance to trauma have not been examined. The
  present study tested whether, in the aftermath of a university mass shooting, compassionate
  goals concurrently and prospectively predicted lower PTSD symptoms indirectly via
  higher social support, and whether this mediation would be stronger with higher
  proximity to the trauma. Method: Participants (N = 369) completed measures four
  months post-shooting (Time 1), and a subset (n = 85) repeated outcome variables
  at eight months (Time 2). Results: As hypothesized, there was a significant moderated
  mediation, with trauma proximity moderating the indirect effect of compassionate
  goals on PTSD symptoms at Time 1 (B = −0.88, SE = 0.28, 95% CI [−1.47, −0.37]) and
  prospectively at Time 2 (B = −1.12, SE = 0.77, 95% CI [−3.16, −0.03]), although
  not when controlling for Time 1 symptoms. The indirect effects were greatest for
  those with higher trauma proximity, suggesting particular relevance for individuals
  most at risk for trauma-related difficulties. Discussion: These findings suggest
  the need for further research into compassionate goals and strategies for fostering
  them, particularly in the context of social or community traumas.'
