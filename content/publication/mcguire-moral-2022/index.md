abstract: 'Background: Veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
  and moral injury can encounter several barriers to treatment including limited access
  to care and low engagement with in-person therapy. Further, most approaches focus
  on alleviating distress rather than cultivating positive experiences that could
  facilitate trauma recovery. One potential way to address these areas and enhance
  trauma-focused treatment is through moral elevation—a distinct, positive emotional
  state described as feeling uplifted and inspired by others’ virtuous actions.   Objective:
  The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a
  novel, web-based moral elevation intervention for veterans with PTSD symptoms and
  moral injury distress (MOVED). This mixed-methods study also examined potential
  changes in targeted outcomes of PTSD symptoms, moral injury distress, quality of
  life, and prosocial behavior.     Methods: In this pilot trial, 48 participants
  were randomized to a MOVED or control condition (24 per condition). Both conditions
  included 8 sessions that lasted 1 month. The MOVED intervention and all components
  across both conditions were administered online. Participants completed self-report
  measures that assessed PTSD symptoms, moral injury distress, quality of life, and
  prosocial behavior at baseline and follow-up. Veterans in the MOVED condition also
  completed an individual qualitative interview at follow-up. We coded qualitative
  response to the follow-up interview and identified emergent themes.   Results: Findings
  suggest the MOVED intervention was largely feasible with evidence for moderate-to-high
  levels of participation, engagement, and retention in MOVED sessions. Both quantitative
  and qualitative results suggest veterans found MOVED to be acceptable and satisfactory
  at the overall treatment level. Further, participants reported high scores for helpfulness
  and engagement at the session level. Veterans who completed MOVED reported a large
  effect size decrease in PTSD symptoms (d=1.44), nearly twice that of the control
  condition (d=0.78). Those in MOVED also reported medium-sized increases in physical
  (d=0.71) and psychological domains of quality of life (d=0.74), in contrast to no
  meaningful changes in the control condition. Unexpectedly, MOVED did not change
  in moral injury distress, whereas the control condition endorsed medium-sized decreases
  in subscales scores. There were no changes in self-reported prosociality for either
  condition. Qualitative feedback further supported high levels of perceived acceptability
  and satisfaction, and positive treatment outcomes across a range of domains including
  behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and social functioning. Veterans also recommended
  adaptations to enhance engagement and maximize the impact of intervention content.   Conclusion:
  Overall, findings indicate that veterans with PTSD and moral injury distress are
  interested in an intervention that is based on exposure and engagement with experiences
  of moral elevation. Following further research and refinement guided by future trials,
  veterans may benefit from this novel approach, which may enhance treatment outcomes
  and increase accessibility for those in need of additional trauma-focused care.'
