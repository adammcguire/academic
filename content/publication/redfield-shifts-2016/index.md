abstract: "Background: Traditional nursing pedagogies have not systematically addressed\
  \ the ageist perspectives students bring into training that threaten competent care\
  \ for older adults. The current study evaluated nursing students' shifts in attitudes,\
  \ knowledge about aging, and social goals during a program of repeated and structured\
  \ social interactions with community-dwelling older adults. Method: Beginning nursing\
  \ students in pairs met with high-functioning older adults four times over 8 months\
  \ to provide brief health promotion activities. Students' knowledge and attitudes\
  \ on aging were assessed at baseline and prior to each visit; social goals were\
  \ assessed after each visit. Results: Multilevel growth curves revealed increases\
  \ in students' knowledge about aging and positive views on caring for older adults.\
  \ Motivation to help older adults (i.e., compassionate goals) did not change, but\
  \ students' motivation to defend their competence (i.e., self-image goals) declined.\
  \ Conclusion: A relational contact-based program may shift knowledge, attitudes,\
  \ and social goals in nursing students, complementing traditional classroom nursing\
  \ education."
