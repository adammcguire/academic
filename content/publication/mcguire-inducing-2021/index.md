abstract: Moral elevation is a positive emotion described as feeling inspired by others?
  virtuous actions. Elevation has several psychosocial benefits, some of which may
  be relevant to trauma-related distress; however, past studies have primarily examined
  elevation in nonclinical, civilian populations or in naturalistic studies. This
  experimental study used mixed methods to assess if veterans with post-traumatic
  stress disorder (PTSD) experience elevation when exposed to elevation stimuli in
  a controlled setting. Participants included 47 veterans with significant PTSD symptoms.
  Following baseline measures and a written trauma narrative, veterans were randomized
  to an elevation or amusement condition where they viewed two videos intended to
  elicit the condition emotion. Veterans also provided a written journal response
  describing their reaction to the videos. Self-report measures were administered
  after each study task to assess state-level elevation and amusement. Veterans randomized
  to the elevation condition reported significantly higher levels of elevation after
  videos compared to veterans in the amusement condition. Qualitative results offered
  further support for differences between groups and identified unique themes related
  to the experience of elevation. Overall, findings indicate it is possible to induce
  elevation in veterans with significant PTSD symptoms. Additionally, qualitative
  results highlight specific benefits of elevation and potential targets for treatment
  integration and future exploration.
