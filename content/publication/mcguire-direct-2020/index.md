abstract: Gratitude has been consistently linked to well-being, but its influence
  on health-related functioning is not well understood. Furthermore, research suggests
  the need to differentiate between-person and within-person effects of personality
  characteristics, and research on gratitude and health has not typically done so.
  This prospective study aimed to (1) differentiate the unique effects of trait and
  state gratitude on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and (2) test state gratitude
  as a mediator between baseline trait gratitude and subsequent HRQoL. Undergraduate
  participants ( N = 141) completed a trait gratitude measure at baseline and then
  repeated measures of weekly state gratitude and HRQoL over eight weeks. Multilevel
  models examined baseline trait gratitude, state gratitude averaged across the study
  (person aggregate) as between-person individual differences, and within-person variability
  in state gratitude (person-centered) as predictors of HRQoL, as well as the indirect
  effect of trait gratitude on HRQoL via state gratitude. Greater aggregate and person-centered
  state gratitude each predicted higher HRQoL. Baseline trait gratitude did not have
  a significant direct effect but prospectively predicted higher HRQoL via higher
  weekly state gratitude. Results suggest that understanding effects of gratitude
  on health-related perceptions requires accounting for both between-person individual
  differences and within-person fluctuation in state gratitude.
