abstract: 'Background: Using an experimental study, we examined the link between state moral elevation and stigmatic beliefs surrounding male veterans with military sexual trauma (MST). Methods: Undergraduate students were presented with a video or written narrative of a male veteran self-disclosing how they struggled with and overcame MST (*n* = 292). Participants completed measures regarding trait and demographic characteristics at baseline, then measures immediately after the disclosure stimulus to assess immediate elevation and stigma-related reactions. Results: Results suggest state-level elevation in response to a veteran self-disclosing their experience with MST was negatively correlated with harmful stigmatic beliefs about MST. A greater predisposition to experience elevation and PTSD symptoms were linked with stronger elevation responses to the stimulus. Conclusion: Findings support the need for further exploration of elevation and its potential to impact public stigma for male veterans with MST.'
