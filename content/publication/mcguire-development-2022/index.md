title: 'Development and validation of the State Moral Elevation Scale: Assessing state-level
  elevation across nonclinical and clinical samples'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Given the inconsistencies with measurements used to assess state-level experiences of moral elevation, and insufficient psychometric analyses for commonly used measures, the State Moral Elevation Scale (SMES) was developed and tested using an online sample (N = 930) including clinical and nonclincial (general) subsamples. Results from this study identified a 9-item measure with 1) excellent reliability, 2) good fit statistics and strict measurement invariance across clinical and nonclinical subsamples, and 3) evidence of construct validity for both subsamples. Findings suggest the SMES is a psychometrically valid and reliable assessment tool for state-level elevation which can be used in both general and clinical populations.'

abstract: Research on moral elevation has steadily increased and identified several
  psychosocial benefits that bear relevance to both the general population and people
  with psychological distress. However, elevation measurement is inconsistent, and
  few state-level measures have been created and critically evaluated to date. To
  address this gap, the State Moral Elevation Scale (SMES) was developed and tested
  using an online sample (N = 930) including subsamples of general participants (nonclinical)
  and those who screened positive for mental health symptoms (clinical). Factor analysis
  indicated a single factor structure with nine items that demonstrated excellent
  reliability. Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit statistics
  and strict measurement invariance across clinical and nonclinical subsamples. Last,
  correlational analyses with related constructs provided evidence of construct validity
  for both subsamples. Thus, the SMES is a psychometrically valid and reliable assessment
  tool for state-level elevation which can be used in both general and clinical populations.
