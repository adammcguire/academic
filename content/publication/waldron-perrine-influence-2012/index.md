abstract: "Objective: Veterans undergoing evaluation for mild traumatic brain injury\
  \ commonly report insomnia, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. This\
  \ study examines the effects of self-reported amount of sleep and subjective sleep\
  \ quality on neuropsychological test performance. Method: 262 veterans were seen\
  \ for neuropsychological assessment in a Veterans Affairs traumatic brain injury\
  \ clinic. All participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep\
  \ satisfaction, and also estimated the number of hours they slept the night before\
  \ the assessment. Factor scores of attention/concentration and memory were created\
  \ using factor analyses. Data were analyzed with linear regression. Results: Depression\
  \ and anxiety were significantly correlated with sleep satisfaction and predictive\
  \ of cognitive ability. Both sleep satisfaction and hours slept were significantly\
  \ correlated with memory, but not attention. After controlling for the effects of\
  \ depression and anxiety, hours slept but not sleep satisfaction was predictive\
  \ of memory test performance. Conclusions: Perceived sleep quality is heavily influenced\
  \ by psychiatric symptoms; therefore, veterans' report of sleep satisfaction may\
  \ merely reflect their overall level of distress. Sleep quantity, however, appears\
  \ to uniquely contribute to memory performance. Thus, assessment of sleep is important\
  \ and provides clinicians with useful information, especially among individuals\
  \ with psychiatric comorbidities."
