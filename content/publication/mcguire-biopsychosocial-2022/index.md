abstract: 'Background and Objectives: A promising approach to incorporate positive
  psychology principles into trauma-focused treatment is moral elevationâ€”feeling inspired
  by witnessing a virtuous act. This study aimed to explore potential links between
  inducing moral elevation and relevant outcomes in a series of case examples. Methods:
  Veterans with probable PTSD completed experimental tasks including a written trauma
  narrative exercise and watching videos designed to elicit elevation. Participants
  also completed baseline assessments, repeated measures of trauma-related cognitions,
  emotions, state elevation, and saliva sample collection. Four individual cases were
  identified and reviewed: two positive responders (high elevation scores after videos)
  and two nonresponders (restricted elevation response). Results: Positive responder
  cases shared a trajectory of decreased cognitions, emotions, and moral injury distress
  from after the trauma narrative exercise to after elevation exercises, whereas nonresponders
  reported minimal to no changes. Positive responders also demonstrated decreases
  in cortisol that continued to decline in a delay period, whereas nonresponders demonstrated
  increases in cortisol. Additional differences were identified regarding history
  of experiences and dispositional traits. Limitations: This case series analysis
  is limited to four participants and does not include a control condition, which
  limits causal claims. These findings also represent experiences in a controlled
  laboratory setting; thus, it is unclear if they generalize to daily life for veterans
  with PTSD. Conclusions: Future work is needed to expand our understanding of whether
  higher levels of state elevation contribute to changes in biopsychosocial outcomes,
  and to determine individual factors that indicate who might benefit from elevation-based
  interventions.'
