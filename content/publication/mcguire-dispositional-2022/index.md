abstract: Background Dispositional gratitude has been implicated as a psychological
  characteristic that may modulate risk for mental health outcomes. Using a population-based
  sample of U.S. military veterans, this study evaluated the association between dispositional
  gratitude and the development of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors over a 7-year
  period. Methods A nationally representative sample of U.S. veterans was surveyed
  at four timepoints across seven years. Analyses were restricted to veterans without
  incident outcomes at baseline. Multivariable analyses were conducted to examine
  the relation between baseline levels of dispositional gratitude and risk of developing
  (a) major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or posttraumatic
  stress disorder (PTSD); (b) suicidal ideation; and (c) suicide attempts. Results
  A total 9.6% of veterans developed MDD, GAD, and/or PTSD, 9.5% developed suicidal
  ideation, and 2.8% reported having attempted suicide over the 7-year follow-up period.
  Among veterans with high levels of dispositional gratitude, incidence was lower
  for MDD/GAD/PTSD (8.0%), suicidal ideation (6.8%), and suicide attempts (1.5%).
  Conversely, veterans with low dispositional gratitude were at substantially higher
  risk of developing MDD/GAD/PTSD (27.7%), suicidal ideation (33.6%), and suicide
  attempts (20.3%). Conclusions High dispositional gratitude may help protect against
  the development of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors in U.S. military veterans,
  whereas low gratitude may increase risk of developing these outcomes. Collectively,
  these results support the potential utility of enhancing gratitude as part of primary
  prevention efforts for veterans, service members, and other populations at heightened
  risk for adverse mental health outcomes.
