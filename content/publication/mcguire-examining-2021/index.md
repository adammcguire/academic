abstract: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance use disorders (SUD) are
  highly comorbid among the veteran population. Impulsivity, particularly negative
  and positive urgency, are prevalent within this dual-diagnosis population and associated
  with negative outcomes. One possible correlate of negative/positive urgency is intolerance
  of uncertainty (IU). IU is associated with exacerbated PTSD symptom severity and
  increased risk for substance use. However, few studies have examined the link between
  IU and negative/positive urgency in dual-diagnosis populations. This study aimed
  to examine whether there was a significant association between trait IU and baseline
  negative and positive urgency in veterans seeking treatment for both PTSD and SUD.
  In a sample of 114 veterans from a 6-week residential treatment program, IU was
  significantly associated with higher negative and positive urgency. Further research
  is warranted to extend these findings and examine whether IU plays an important
  role in negative/positive urgency for dual-diagnosis populations.
