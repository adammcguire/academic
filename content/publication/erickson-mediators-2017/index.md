abstract: "Objectives: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is thought to\
  \ mediate the effects of stress on illness. Research has identified a limited number\
  \ of psychological variables that modulate human HPA responses to stressors (e.g.\
  \ perceived control and social support). Prosocial goals can reduce subjective stress,\
  \ but have not been carefully examined in experimental settings where pathways of\
  \ impact on biological stress markers may be traced. Recent work demonstrated that\
  \ coaching individuals to strive to help others reduced HPA responses to the Trier\
  \ Social Stress Test (TSST) relative to other cognitive interventions. However,\
  \ identification of mediational pathways, which were not examined in the original\
  \ study, is necessary to determine whether the HPA buffering effects were due to\
  \ helping motivations (compassionate goals; CGs) rather than via previously identified\
  \ variables such as control or support. Methods: In this new analysis, we combined\
  \ the original cortisol data with novel observer ratings of interpersonal behavior\
  \ and psychological variables during the stress task, and conducted new, theory-driven\
  \ analyses to determine psychological mediators for the intervention's effect on\
  \ cortisol responses (N = 54; 21 females, 33 males; 486 cortisol samples). Results:\
  \ Control, support, and task ego-threat failed to account for the effects of the\
  \ intervention. As hypothesized, self and observer-rated CGs, as well as observer-rated\
  \ perceptions of participants’ interpersonal behavior as morally desirable (but\
  \ not as dominant or affiliative) were significant mediators of neuroendocrine responses.\
  \ Conclusions: The findings suggest that stress-reduction interventions based on\
  \ prosocial behavior should target particular motivational and interpersonal features."
