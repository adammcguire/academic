abstract: 'Given the risk for veterans with PTSD and moral injury to experience negative
  social consequences, researchers have increasingly focused on social functioning
  assessment; however, one gap is the lack of observer-rated assessment and reliance
  on self-report measures. To better understand the dynamic process of social functioning
  and how it is affected by PTSD and moral injury distress, it is important to gain
  perspective on how others perceive those veterans and their interactions. Interpersonal
  circumplex assessments, such as the Impact Message Inventory-Circumplex (IMI-C),
  may provide that perspective by asking others to rate observations of veterans’
  social behaviors, which is scored in a circular pattern of eight octants representing
  unique blends of two orthogonal dimensions: affiliation (cold-warm) and control
  (dominant-submissive). This study demonstrated how the IMI-C can be used to examine
  significant others’ perceptions of veterans with PTSD and moral injury at baseline
  (n = 23), prior to a novel positive psychology treatment that focused on inducing
  moral elevation and its benefits. Using this fine-grained analysis of interpersonal
  behaviors, this study also described two case studies of veterans who demonstrated
  notable pre-post changes in how they were perceived by others, providing contextual
  information including quantitative changes in PTSD symptoms, moral injury, and quality
  of life, and qualitative reports of interpersonal changes. Preliminary findings
  suggest significant others characterized veterans’ impact as mostly warm and neither
  dominant or submissive at baseline. Case examples also suggest meaningful interpersonal
  shifts in two veterans who found benefit in the moral elevation-based intervention.
  Lastly, clinical and research implications are discussed.'
