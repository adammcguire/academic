abstract: Whereas past studies primarily examined state-level gratitude measured across
  long periods of time and in the context of positive events, this study assessed
  situational predictors of state gratitude and its affective outcomes in the context
  of specific positive and negative naturalistic events. Across seven weeks, 147 undergraduates
  recorded best and worst weekly events, depressive symptoms, as well as gratitude
  and positive affect (PA) anchored to those events. Independent raters coded events
  as dependent or independent of participantsâ€™ agency and interpersonal or noninterpersonal.
  Multilevel models showed there was a significant interaction between agency and
  interpersonal status for positive events, and simple effects tests indicated participants
  reported higher levels of gratitude for independent-interpersonal events compared
  to other potential event types. Unexpectedly, participants also reported higher
  gratitude for dependent events if they were interpersonal in nature. Negative event-anchored
  state gratitude was also higher for interpersonal events as indicated by a significant
  main effect. Lastly, within-person variability in event-anchored state gratitude
  was associated with higher state PA following both best and worst events, but only
  state gratitude anchored to best events was related to lower weekly depressive symptoms.
  Overall, results demonstrated that naturally occurring state gratitude for specific
  events was differentially impacted by situational factors, and that within-person
  variability in gratitude following both positive and negative events is related
  to positive affective outcomes.
