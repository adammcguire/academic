abstract: Moral elevation is described as feeling inspired after witnessing someone
  perform a virtuous act. Past work suggests the features of moral elevation may be
  contrary to PTSD, yet few studies have directly tested its impact on relevant symptoms.
  This experimental study assessed changes in trauma-related cognitions and emotions
  from after a trauma reminder task to after an elevation induction exercise. We hypothesized
  that higher elevation after the induction exercise would be associated with greater
  reductions in cognitions and emotions. Veterans with probable PTSD (N = 38) completed
  measures of trauma-related cognitions and emotions, once after a written trauma
  narrative exercise (T1) and again after watching two videos designed to elicit elevation
  (T2). Veterans also completed measures of state elevation after each video. Results
  suggest veterans experienced small, significant decreases in self-blame (d = 0.36)
  and negative beliefs about others (d = 0.46), and medium, significant decreases
  in guilt (d = 0.68), shame (d = 0.60), and negative beliefs about self (d = 0.69)
  between T1 and T2. As hypothesized, higher elevation was associated with significantly
  greater reductions in multiple outcomes above and beyond the effects of general
  positive affect. Specifically, there were medium effects for changes in shame (β
  = −0.42, SE = 0.17, p = .019, Δf2 = 0.25), negative view of others (β = −0.34,
  SE = 0.16, p = .044, Δf2 = 0.20), and a large effect for changes in negative view
  of self (β = −0.31, SE = 0.13, p = .019, Δf2 = 0.54). These findings suggest elevation
  may be well-suited to target trauma-related symptoms and future research should
  further examine its clinical utility.
