abstract: Social support is a known protective factor against the negative psychological
  impact of natural disasters. Most past research has examined how the effects of
  exposure to traumatic events influences whether someone meets diagnostic criteria
  for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); it has also suggested sequelae
  of disaster exposure depends on whether survivors are displaced from their homes.
  To capture the full range of the psychological impact of natural disasters, we examined
  the buffering effects of social support on depressive symptoms and cluster‐specific
  PTSD symptoms, with consideration of displacement status. In a survey conducted
  18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina, 810 adults exposed to the disaster reported
  the number of Katrina‐related traumatic events experienced, perceived social support
  2 months post‐Katrina, and cluster‐specific PTSD and depressive symptoms experienced
  since Katrina. Analyses assessed the moderating effects of social support and displacement
  and the conditional effects of displacement status. Social support significantly
  buffered the negative effect of Katrina‐related traumatic events on depressive symptoms,
  B = −0.10, p = .001, and avoidance and arousal PTSD symptoms, B = −0.02, p = .035
  and B = −0.02, p = .042, respectively. Three‐way interactions were nonsignificant.
  Conditional effects indicated social support buffered development of depressive
  symptoms across all residents; however, the moderating effects of support on avoidance
  and arousal symptoms only appeared significant for nondisplaced residents. Results
  highlight the protective effects of disaster‐related social support among nondisplaced
  individuals, and suggest displaced individuals may require more formal supports
  for PTSD symptom reduction following a natural disaster.
