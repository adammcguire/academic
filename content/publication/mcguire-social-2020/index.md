abstract: 'Introduction: Social distancing and sheltering-in-place mitigate the physical
  health risks of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19); however, there are concerns about
  the impact on mental health and social engagement.Methods: We used data from a U.S.-based
  online survey (March 2020) to examine patterns of social support and prosocial behavior,
  explore differences between people with and without depression or anxiety, and explore
  correlates of social engagement in both groups, including symptom severity in the
  clinical group.Results: The clinical group reported greater social engagement. In
  both groups, social engagement was positively associated with COVID-19-related worry
  and trait moral elevation; mindfulness was positively associated with all outcomes
  for the clinical group only. Social interaction frequency had little influence on
  outcomes. Depressive symptom severity was positively associated with all outcomes,
  whereas anxiety was negatively associated with prosocial behavior.Discussion: These
  findings highlight how social engagement was experienced early in the U.S. COVID-19
  crisis.'
