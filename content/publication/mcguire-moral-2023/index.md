title: 'Moral Elevation Online Intervention for Veterans Experiencing Distress Related
  to Posttraumatic Stress Disorder and Moral Injury (MOVED): Pilot Trial of a 4-week
  positive psychology web-based intervention'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Novel approaches are needed to target PTSD and psychosocial growth or functional recovery. One potentail way to address this critical ned is through moral elevation. This pilot trial tested a new web-based moral elevation intervention with post-9/11 Veterans who experienced a morally injurious event and PTSD symptoms. MOVED is an 8-session intervention administered over 4 weeks that aims to elicit moral elevation and its benefits. Findings suggested MOVED was considered feasible and satisfactory, demonstrated high levels of engagement, and established preliminary evidence that this approach is linked with lower PTSD symptoms and enhanced QOL for Veterans with PTSD and moral injury.'

abstract: 'Background: Veterans with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral
  injury can encounter several barriers to treatment, including limited access to
  care and low engagement with therapy. Furthermore, most treatment approaches focus
  on alleviating distress rather than cultivating positive experiences that could
  facilitate trauma recovery. A potential way to address these issues is through moral
  elevation: feeling uplifted and inspired by othersâ€™ virtuous actions. Objective:
  This study aimed to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, web-based
  moral elevation intervention for veterans with PTSD symptoms and moral injury distress
  (Moral Elevation Online Intervention for Veterans Experiencing Distress Related
  to PTSD and Moral Injury [MOVED]). This mixed methods study also examined potential
  changes in PTSD symptoms, moral injury distress, quality of life, and prosocial
  behavior. Methods: In this pilot trial, 48 participants were randomized to a MOVED
  or control condition (24 participants per condition). Both conditions included 8
  sessions and lasted 1 month. The MOVED intervention and all survey components across
  both conditions were administered online. Participants completed self-report measures
  that assessed PTSD symptoms, moral injury distress, quality of life, and prosocial
  behavior at baseline and follow-up. Veterans in the MOVED condition also completed
  individual qualitative interviews at follow-up. We coded qualitative responses to
  interviews and identified emergent themes. Results: Findings suggest the MOVED intervention
  was largely feasible, with evidence for moderate-to-high levels of participation,
  engagement, and retention in MOVED sessions. Both quantitative and qualitative results
  suggest veterans found MOVED to be acceptable and satisfactory at the overall treatment
  level. Furthermore, participants reported high scores for helpfulness and engagement
  at the session level. Veterans who completed MOVED reported large within-person
  decreases in PTSD symptoms (Cohen d=1.44), approximately twice that of veterans
  in the control condition (Cohen d=0.78). Those in MOVED also reported medium-sized
  increases in physical (Cohen d=0.71) and psychological domains of quality of life
  (Cohen d=0.74), compared with no meaningful changes in the control condition. Unexpectedly,
  MOVED veterans reported no decrease in moral injury distress, whereas veterans in
  the control condition endorsed a medium-sized decrease in the total score. There
  were no changes in prosociality for either condition. Qualitative feedback further
  supported high levels of perceived acceptability and satisfaction and positive treatment
  outcomes across a range of domains, including behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and
  social functioning. Veterans also recommended adaptations to enhance engagement
  and maximize the impact of intervention content. Conclusions: Overall, findings
  indicate that veterans with PTSD and moral injury distress were interested in an
  intervention based on exposure to and engagement with experiences of moral elevation.
  After further research and refinement guided by future trials, veterans may benefit
  from this novel approach, which may enhance treatment outcomes and increase treatment
  accessibility for those in need of additional trauma-focused care.'
