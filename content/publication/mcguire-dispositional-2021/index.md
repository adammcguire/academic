abstract: "Dispositional gratitude may be linked to positive mental health outcomes,\
  \ yet population-based data on this association are lacking. Military veterans are\
  \ an ideal population in which to examine this question given high rates of psychiatric\
  \ morbidities and efforts to promote psychological resilience in this population.\
  \ Data were analyzed from a nationally representative sample of 3151 U.S. veterans.\
  \ Veterans were separated into three groups based on an assessment of level of dispositional\
  \ gratitude: high gratitude (weighted 79.8%), moderate gratitude (9.6%), and low\
  \ gratitude (10.5%). Multivariable analyses examined the associations between level\
  \ of dispositional gratitude, and measures of mental health and psychosocial variables.\
  \ A “dose-response” association was observed between levels of dispositional gratitude\
  \ and odds of psychiatric morbidities. Higher dispositional gratitude was associated\
  \ with decreased risk for lifetime history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),\
  \ major depressive disorder (MDD), social phobia, nicotine dependence, and suicide\
  \ attempts, and decreased risk for current PTSD, MDD, generalized anxiety disorder,\
  \ and suicidal ideation (odds ratio range = 0.16–0.65). Higher dispositional gratitude\
  \ was additionally associated with resilience-promoting characteristics such as\
  \ optimism, curiosity, purpose in life, perceived social support, and religiosity/spirituality\
  \ (Cohen's d range = 0.11–0.73). Dispositional gratitude is prevalent in U.S. veterans,\
  \ is negatively associated with psychiatric morbidities, and may help promote psychosocial\
  \ factors linked to resilience in this population. Stratification of veterans with\
  \ low, moderate, and high dispositional gratitude may help identify those who are\
  \ at increased risk for psychiatric illness and in need of additional support."
