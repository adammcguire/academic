abstract: Previous research has indicated that at clinical levels, health anxiety
  is cross‐sectionally correlated with both somatic symptoms and health‐related quality
  of life (HRQOL). However, research has not tested mediational models of how health
  anxiety may lead to diminished HRQOL prospectively, and more broadly outside of
  clinical contexts. In the context of an eight‐week prospective diary study of 118
  subclinical adults, we examined whether somatic symptoms mediate the relationship
  between health anxiety and both same‐week HRQOL and week‐to‐week change in HRQOL.
  Multilevel modelling indicated that somatic symptoms fully mediated the relationship
  between HA and HRQOL concurrently and over time. Even after accounting for depressive
  symptoms, individuals who were predisposed to experience illness preoccupation and
  oversensitivity to bodily sensations were at risk for higher somatic symptoms and
  thereby poorer levels of perceived health. Thus, both health anxiety and somatic
  symptoms may be an important target for interventions seeking to improve HRQOL in
  subclinical populations.
