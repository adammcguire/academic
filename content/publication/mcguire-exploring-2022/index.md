abstract: 'Social isolation is a relevant problem for veterans who are at risk for
  disengaging from others as a function of transition stress from military life to
  civilian life, and given high rates of exposure to trauma and psychological distress.
  Few researchers have examined social isolation in veterans over time, particularly
  during COVID-19 that led to significant barriers and restrictions on social interactions.
  The purpose of this longitudinal study was to assess veteransâ€™ experience of social
  isolation and its mental health and social functioning correlates during a 6-month
  period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 188 United States veterans of
  the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, who completed a total of four assessments: one every
  two months for a total duration of six months. Surveys included measures of global
  mental health and social functioning as indicated by perceived emotional support,
  quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. Multilevel modeling was used to assess
  1) growth models to determine whether social isolation changed over time and the
  trajectory of that change (i.e., linear or quadratic); and 2) whether social isolation
  was related to both concurrent and prospective indicators of mental health and social
  functioning. All analyses included person mean centered and grand mean centered
  isolation to assess for within-and between-person effects. Veterans reported a quadratic
  trajectory in social isolation that decreased slightly and stabilized over time.
  Findings indicate that higher social isolation, at both the within- and between-person
  level, was negatively associated with concurrent emotional support, mental health,
  quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. However, all prospective effects were
  nonsignificant at the within-person level. Results suggest although isolation may
  decrease over time, veterans report worse mental health and social functioning during
  times when they report higher levels of social isolation compared to themselves
  and others. Future work is needed to determine if interventions can be applied during
  those times to prevent or target those negative associations.'
