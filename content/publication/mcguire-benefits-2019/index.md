abstract: Given the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral injury
  in veterans and limitations to current treatments, novel approaches are needed to
  target both PTSD and moral injury and directly impact psychosocial growth. One potential
  way to address this need is through moral elevation—a positive emotional state described
  as feeling uplifted and inspired by others’ virtuous actions. This article proposes
  a theoretical framework for understanding how elevation could benefit veterans and
  presents preliminary findings from a pilot study, which provides the first known
  indication that elevation could be linked with psychological health and social functioning
  in veterans with significant trauma-related distress.
