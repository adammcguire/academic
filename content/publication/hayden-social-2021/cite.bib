	abstract = {The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has led to significant stressors and shifts in social life, yet social interactions experienced by people with trauma exposure during the COVID pandemic is largely unknown. This study assessed the frequency of interactions, social support given and received, and prosocial behavior using online survey methods (N = 1049). We examined differences in experiences across three groups: no trauma exposure, trauma-exposed with low PTSD symptoms, and trauma-exposed with high PTSD symptoms. We also explored correlations between social interactions and PTSD symptom clusters. Results indicated significant differences across groups and the high PTSD group reported stronger associations between social interaction variables and symptom clusters, on average.},
