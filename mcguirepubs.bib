	abstract = {Social support is a known protective factor against the negative psychological impact of natural disasters. Most past research has examined how the effects of exposure to traumatic events influences whether someone meets diagnostic criteria for depression and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); it has also suggested sequelae of disaster exposure depends on whether survivors are displaced from their homes. To capture the full range of the psychological impact of natural disasters, we examined the buffering effects of social support on depressive symptoms and cluster‐specific PTSD symptoms, with consideration of displacement status. In a survey conducted 18 to 24 months after Hurricane Katrina, 810 adults exposed to the disaster reported the number of Katrina‐related traumatic events experienced, perceived social support 2 months post‐Katrina, and cluster‐specific PTSD and depressive symptoms experienced since Katrina. Analyses assessed the moderating effects of social support and displacement and the conditional effects of displacement status. Social support significantly buffered the negative effect of Katrina‐related traumatic events on depressive symptoms, B = −0.10, p = .001, and avoidance and arousal PTSD symptoms, B = −0.02, p = .035 and B = −0.02, p = .042, respectively. Three‐way interactions were nonsignificant. Conditional effects indicated social support buffered development of depressive symptoms across all residents; however, the moderating effects of support on avoidance and arousal symptoms only appeared significant for nondisplaced residents. Results highlight the protective effects of disaster‐related social support among nondisplaced individuals, and suggest displaced individuals may require more formal supports for PTSD symptom reduction following a natural disaster.},

	abstract = {Objective: Veterans undergoing evaluation for mild traumatic brain injury commonly report insomnia, psychiatric symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction. This study examines the effects of self-reported amount of sleep and subjective sleep quality on neuropsychological test performance.
Method: 262 veterans were seen for neuropsychological assessment in a Veterans Affairs traumatic brain injury clinic. All participants completed measures of depression, anxiety, and sleep satisfaction, and also estimated the number of hours they slept the night before the assessment. Factor scores of attention/concentration and memory were created using factor analyses. Data were analyzed with linear regression.
Results: Depression and anxiety were significantly correlated with sleep satisfaction and predictive of cognitive ability. Both sleep satisfaction and hours slept were significantly correlated with memory, but not attention. After controlling for the effects of depression and anxiety, hours slept but not sleep satisfaction was predictive of memory test performance.
Conclusions: Perceived sleep quality is heavily influenced by psychiatric symptoms; therefore, veterans' report of sleep satisfaction may merely reflect their overall level of distress. Sleep quantity, however, appears to uniquely contribute to memory performance. Thus, assessment of sleep is important and provides clinicians with useful information, especially among individuals with psychiatric comorbidities.},

However, the authors are not aware of any research examining trauma-related cognitions as a treatment mechanism in a sample of individuals with comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder (SUD). Accordingly, the present study sought to address this gap in the literature and examined the relationship between trauma-related cognitions and treatment outcomes within a sample of seventy-two veterans diagnosed with PTSD and SUD. Veterans completed a 6-week day CPT-based treatment program that included cognitive processing therapy as a central component. Measures of trauma-related cognitions, PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and trauma-cued substance craving were completed at pre- and post-treatment. As expected, trauma-related cognitions were associated with several PTSD-related variables prior to treatment. Furthermore, results of a within-subjects mediational analysis indicated that maladaptive trauma-related cognitions decreased during the treatment program and accounted for a significant portion of the variance in the reduction of PTSD and depressive symptoms at post-treatment. This study provides support for the position that attempts to modify dysfunctional trauma-related cognitions among veterans with co-occurring PTSD and SUD can lead to desirable treatment outcomes.},

As expected, compassionate goals toward others incrementally predicted higher PTG beyond perceptions of compassionate goals from others. Also, elevation concurrently and prospectively predicted higher PTG. Lastly, elevation mediated effects of others’ compassionate goals on PTG, as hypothesized (95\% CI = 2.59 to 5.43).

	abstract = {Objectives: The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis is thought to mediate the effects of stress on illness. Research has identified a limited number of psychological variables that modulate human HPA responses to stressors (e.g. perceived control and social support). Prosocial goals can reduce subjective stress, but have not been carefully examined in experimental settings where pathways of impact on biological stress markers may be traced. Recent work demonstrated that coaching individuals to strive to help others reduced HPA responses to the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) relative to other cognitive interventions. However, identification of mediational pathways, which were not examined in the original study, is necessary to determine whether the HPA buffering effects were due to helping motivations (compassionate goals; CGs) rather than via previously identified variables such as control or support.
Methods: In this new analysis, we combined the original cortisol data with novel observer ratings of interpersonal behavior and psychological variables during the stress task, and conducted new, theory-driven analyses to determine psychological mediators for the intervention's effect on cortisol responses (N = 54; 21 females, 33 males; 486 cortisol samples).
Results: Control, support, and task ego-threat failed to account for the effects of the intervention. As hypothesized, self and observer-rated CGs, as well as observer-rated perceptions of participants’ interpersonal behavior as morally desirable (but not as dominant or affiliative) were significant mediators of neuroendocrine responses.
Conclusions: The findings suggest that stress-reduction interventions based on prosocial behavior should target particular motivational and interpersonal features.},

	abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by strong negative emotions, often in response to trauma cues or reminders. Subsequent emotion regulation strategies impact the maintenance of PTSD symptoms and other trauma-related outcomes (depression, substance use). This study aimed to examine a range of trauma-cued emotions to enhance our understanding of changes following treatment and their potential role in improving relevant outcomes. Participants included 67 veterans diagnosed with PTSD and a substance use disorder who completed a dual diagnosis residential program that used cognitive processing therapy. At pre- and posttreatment, we measured 8 negative emotions following a trauma recall and PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and negative urgency (impulsivity following negative emotions) as treatment outcomes. We used t-tests to assess changes at posttreatment and a within-subjects mediational analysis to test whether changes in trauma-cued emotions mediated treatment outcomes. Participants reported moderate, significant decreases for 5 emotions at posttreatment: anger at self, disgust at self, fear, guilt, and sadness (d ≥ 0.50), whereas nonsignificant changes were found for anger at others, disgust at others, and shame. Mediation analyses indicated greater reductions in trauma-cued sadness had a significant indirect effect on improvement in PTSD symptoms, depressive symptoms, and negative urgency. Reductions in disgust at self and fear also demonstrated a significant indirect effect on depressive symptom improvement. In this dual diagnosis program, veterans reported a significant reduction in some, but not all, trauma-cued emotions, and improvements in only select emotions accounted for a significant portion of improvement in relevant treatment outcomes.},

We tested whether veterans seeking psychotherapy for comorbid PTSD and substance use disorder reported increased resilience from pre- to posttreatment. We also tested whether increased resilience was associated with greater decreases in posttreatment PTSD and substance use disorder symptoms. Methods: Participants were 29 male veterans (Mage = 49.07 years, SD = 11.24 years) receiving six-week residential day treatment including cognitive processing therapy for PTSD and cognitive behavioral therapy for substance use disorder. Resilience, PTSD symptoms, and trauma cue-related cravings were assessed at pre- and posttreatment. Results: Veterans reported a large, significant increase in resilience posttreatment (Mdiff = 14.24, t = −4.22, p {\textless} .001, d = 0.74). Greater increases in resilience were significantly associated with fewer PTSD symptoms (β = −0.37, p = .049, sr = −.36) and trauma-cued cravings (β = −0.39, p = .006, sr = −.38) posttreatment when controlling for pretreatment scores and baseline depressive symptoms.

Despite knowledge of the relationship between information source and symptom presentation, little work has focused on a characterization of where Veterans receive their information. The present study aims to fill this gap in the literature. We asked 152 Veterans who screened positive for possible TBI within the VA healthcare system about the sources of information they have encountered regarding TBI and its sequelae. “Friends in the military” was the most frequently cited source of information, followed by the Internet, medical professionals, and informational pamphlets. The results of this survey indicate that Veterans are being exposed to information about TBI prior to a formal evaluation and that this information comes from multiple sources of varying reliability. Future research should focus on evaluating and ultimately improving the reliability of this information in order to positively influence the treatment of Veterans.},

In the context of an eight‐week prospective diary study of 118 subclinical adults, we examined whether somatic symptoms mediate the relationship between health anxiety and both same‐week HRQOL and week‐to‐week change in HRQOL. Multilevel modelling indicated that somatic symptoms fully mediated the relationship between HA and HRQOL concurrently and over time. Even after accounting for depressive symptoms, individuals who were predisposed to experience illness preoccupation and oversensitivity to bodily sensations were at risk for higher somatic symptoms and thereby poorer levels of perceived health.

Results: Multilevel growth curves revealed increases in students' knowledge about aging and positive views on caring for older adults. Motivation to help older adults (i.e., compassionate goals) did not change, but students' motivation to defend their competence (i.e., self-image goals) declined.

Undergraduate participants ( N = 141) completed a trait gratitude measure at baseline and then repeated measures of weekly state gratitude and HRQoL over eight weeks. Multilevel models examined baseline trait gratitude, state gratitude averaged across the study (person aggregate) as between-person individual differences, and within-person variability in state gratitude (person-centered) as predictors of HRQoL, as well as the indirect effect of trait gratitude on HRQoL via state gratitude. Greater aggregate and person-centered state gratitude each predicted higher HRQoL. Baseline trait gratitude did not have a significant direct effect but prospectively predicted higher HRQoL via higher weekly state gratitude.

	abstract = {Introduction: Social support is known to buffer posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, but the stress-buffering properties of striving to help and support others (compassionate goals) have received less attention. Recent research suggests that compassionate goals shape social support processes and dampen stress responses following social threat, but their relevance to trauma have not been examined. The present study tested whether, in the aftermath of a university mass shooting, compassionate goals concurrently and prospectively predicted lower PTSD symptoms indirectly via higher social support, and whether this mediation would be stronger with higher proximity to the trauma. Method: Participants (N = 369) completed measures four months post-shooting (Time 1), and a subset (n = 85) repeated outcome variables at eight months (Time 2). Results: As hypothesized, there was a significant moderated mediation, with trauma proximity moderating the indirect effect of compassionate goals on PTSD symptoms at Time 1 (B = −0.88, SE = 0.28, 95\% CI [−1.47, −0.37]) and prospectively at Time 2 (B = −1.12, SE = 0.77, 95\% CI [−3.16, −0.03]), although not when controlling for Time 1 symptoms. The indirect effects were greatest for those with higher trauma proximity, suggesting particular relevance for individuals most at risk for trauma-related difficulties. Discussion: These findings suggest the need for further research into compassionate goals and strategies for fostering them, particularly in the context of social or community traumas.},

	abstract = {Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major health concern among veterans, specifically African American veterans, and is commonly comorbid with other negative mental health outcomes including substance use disorders (SUD) and symptoms of depression. The current study examined intolerance of uncertainty as a mediator of the relationship between PTSD and depression symptoms in a sample of African American veterans with a dual diagnosis of PTSD and SUD. Participants included 113 African American veterans who were in treatment for PTSD and SUD at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Five mediation analyses were conducted to examine the mediational effect of intolerance of uncertainty on the relationship between PTSD symptom clusters (i.e., total, hyperarousal, numbness, avoidance, and intrusion) and depression symptoms. Findings indicated that intolerance of uncertainty mediated the relationship between four of the five mediation models (i.e., total symptoms, hyperarousal, numbness, and intrusion). These results imply that for African American veterans, higher levels of certain PTSD symptoms were associated with higher levels of intolerance of uncertainty, which in turn were related to increased levels of depression symptoms.},

Independent raters coded events as dependent or independent of participants’ agency and interpersonal or noninterpersonal. Multilevel models showed there was a significant interaction between agency and interpersonal status for positive events, and simple effects tests indicated participants reported higher levels of gratitude for independent-interpersonal events compared to other potential event types. Unexpectedly, participants also reported higher gratitude for dependent events if they were interpersonal in nature. Negative event-anchored state gratitude was also higher for interpersonal events as indicated by a significant main effect. Lastly, within-person variability in event-anchored state gratitude was associated with higher state PA following both best and worst events, but only state gratitude anchored to best events was related to lower weekly depressive symptoms. Overall, results demonstrated that naturally occurring state gratitude for specific events was differentially impacted by situational factors, and that within-person variability in gratitude following both positive and negative events is related to positive affective outcomes.},

Military veterans are an ideal population in which to examine this question given high rates of psychiatric morbidities and efforts to promote psychological resilience in this population. Data were analyzed from a nationally representative sample of 3151 U.S. veterans. Veterans were separated into three groups based on an assessment of level of dispositional gratitude: high gratitude (weighted 79.8\%), moderate gratitude (9.6\%), and low gratitude (10.5\%). Multivariable analyses examined the associations between level of dispositional gratitude, and measures of mental health and psychosocial variables. A “dose-response” association was observed between levels of dispositional gratitude and odds of psychiatric morbidities. Higher dispositional gratitude was associated with decreased risk for lifetime history of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), major depressive disorder (MDD), social phobia, nicotine dependence, and suicide attempts, and decreased risk for current PTSD, MDD, generalized anxiety disorder, and suicidal ideation (odds ratio range = 0.16–0.65). Higher dispositional gratitude was additionally associated with resilience-promoting characteristics such as optimism, curiosity, purpose in life, perceived social support, and religiosity/spirituality (Cohen's d range = 0.11–0.73). Dispositional gratitude is prevalent in U.S. veterans, is negatively associated with psychiatric morbidities, and may help promote psychosocial factors linked to resilience in this population. Stratification of veterans with low, moderate, and high dispositional gratitude may help identify those who are at increased risk for psychiatric illness and in need of additional support.},

Multigroup confirmatory factor analysis indicated good fit statistics and strict measurement invariance across clinical and nonclinical subsamples.

Past work suggests the features of moral elevation may be contrary to PTSD, yet few studies have directly tested its impact on relevant symptoms. This experimental study assessed changes in trauma-related cognitions and emotions from after a trauma reminder task to after an elevation induction exercise. We hypothesized that higher elevation after the induction exercise would be associated with greater reductions in cognitions and emotions. Veterans with probable PTSD (N = 38) completed measures of trauma-related cognitions and emotions, once after a written trauma narrative exercise (T1) and again after watching two videos designed to elicit elevation (T2). Veterans also completed measures of state elevation after each video. Results suggest veterans experienced small, significant decreases in self-blame (d = 0.36) and negative beliefs about others (d = 0.46), and medium, significant decreases in guilt (d = 0.68), shame (d = 0.60), and negative beliefs about self (d = 0.69) between T1 and T2. As hypothesized, higher elevation was associated with significantly greater reductions in multiple outcomes above and beyond the effects of general positive affect. Specifically, there were medium effects for changes in shame (β = −0.42, SE = 0.17, p = 0.019, Δf2 = 0.25), negative view of others (β = −0.34, SE = 0.16, p = 0.044, Δf2 = 0.20), and a large effect for changes in negative view of self (β = −0.31, SE = 0.13, p = 0.019, Δf2 = 0.54).

	abstract = {Background
Dispositional gratitude has been implicated as a psychological characteristic that may modulate risk for mental health outcomes. Using a population-based sample of U.S. military veterans, this study evaluated the association between dispositional gratitude and the development of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors over a 7-year period.
Methods
A nationally representative sample of U.S. veterans was surveyed at four timepoints across seven years. Analyses were restricted to veterans without incident outcomes at baseline. Multivariable analyses were conducted to examine the relation between baseline levels of dispositional gratitude and risk of developing (a) major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); (b) suicidal ideation; and (c) suicide attempts.
Results
A total 9.6\% of veterans developed MDD, GAD, and/or PTSD, 9.5\% developed suicidal ideation, and 2.8\% reported having attempted suicide over the 7-year follow-up period. Among veterans with high levels of dispositional gratitude, incidence was lower for MDD/GAD/PTSD (8.0\%), suicidal ideation (6.8\%), and suicide attempts (1.5\%). Conversely, veterans with low dispositional gratitude were at substantially higher risk of developing MDD/GAD/PTSD (27.7\%), suicidal ideation (33.6\%), and suicide attempts (20.3\%).
Conclusions
High dispositional gratitude may help protect against the development of psychopathology and suicidal behaviors in U.S. military veterans, whereas low gratitude may increase risk of developing these outcomes. Collectively, these results support the potential utility of enhancing gratitude as part of primary prevention efforts for veterans, service members, and other populations at heightened risk for adverse mental health outcomes.},

In the article (https://doi.org/10.1037/tra0001143), the Supplemental materials link was missing from the title page. All versions of this article have been corrected.] Objective: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common problem for veterans. Resilience, the tendency to bounce back from difficult circumstances, is negatively associated with posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) among individuals with a history of trauma, and it may be important to understand responses to trauma reminders. Method: Using a quasi-experimental design, we examined the association between trait resilience and state PTCs in veterans with PTSD (n = 47, Mage = 48.60, 91.8\% male) at two points: following a written trauma narrative exposure (Time 1 [T1]), and following a subsequent positive distraction task (i.e., brief, positive video; Time 2 [T2]). Results: After controlling for PTSD symptom severity and combat exposure, resilience was negatively associated with PTCs at T1 (ΔR2 = .19) and T2 (ΔR2 = .13). However, resilience was a poor predictor of change in PTCs from T1 to T2. We also examined the relationship between resilience and subtypes of PTCs: resilience was associated with negative views of the self (T1, ΔR2 = .24) but not negative views of the world or self-blame (T1, ΔR2s ≤ .07); these results were consistent at T2. Conclusions: Thus, resilience may attenuate negative trauma-related cognitions after trauma recall; however, this study was not designed to test causal pathways. Future research could examine whether resilience-building exercises reduce negative PTCs after trauma reminders among veterans. Additional research is needed to generalize to other trauma-exposed populations. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Background: Veterans suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and moral injury can encounter several barriers to treatment including limited access to care and low engagement with in-person therapy. Further, most approaches focus on alleviating distress rather than cultivating positive experiences that could facilitate trauma recovery. One potential way to address these areas and enhance trauma-focused treatment is through moral elevation—a distinct, positive emotional state described as feeling uplifted and inspired by others’ virtuous actions. 

Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility and acceptability of a novel, web-based moral elevation intervention for veterans with PTSD symptoms and moral injury distress (MOVED). This mixed-methods study also examined potential changes in targeted outcomes of PTSD symptoms, moral injury distress, quality of life, and prosocial behavior.   

Methods: In this pilot trial, 48 participants were randomized to a MOVED or control condition (24 per condition). Both conditions included 8 sessions that lasted 1 month. The MOVED intervention and all components across both conditions were administered online. Participants completed self-report measures that assessed PTSD symptoms, moral injury distress, quality of life, and prosocial behavior at baseline and follow-up. Veterans in the MOVED condition also completed an individual qualitative interview at follow-up. We coded qualitative response to the follow-up interview and identified emergent themes. 

Results: Findings suggest the MOVED intervention was largely feasible with evidence for moderate-to-high levels of participation, engagement, and retention in MOVED sessions. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggest veterans found MOVED to be acceptable and satisfactory at the overall treatment level. Further, participants reported high scores for helpfulness and engagement at the session level. Veterans who completed MOVED reported a large effect size decrease in PTSD symptoms (d=1.44), nearly twice that of the control condition (d=0.78). Those in MOVED also reported medium-sized increases in physical (d=0.71) and psychological domains of quality of life (d=0.74), in contrast to no meaningful changes in the control condition. Unexpectedly, MOVED did not change in moral injury distress, whereas the control condition endorsed medium-sized decreases in subscales scores. There were no changes in self-reported prosociality for either condition. Qualitative feedback further supported high levels of perceived acceptability and satisfaction, and positive treatment outcomes across a range of domains including behaviors, cognitions, emotions, and social functioning. Veterans also recommended adaptations to enhance engagement and maximize the impact of intervention content. 

Conclusion: Overall, findings indicate that veterans with PTSD and moral injury distress are interested in an intervention that is based on exposure and engagement with experiences of moral elevation. Following further research and refinement guided by future trials, veterans may benefit from this novel approach, which may enhance treatment outcomes and increase accessibility for those in need of additional trauma-focused care.},

Results: Positive responder cases shared a trajectory of decreased cognitions, emotions, and moral injury distress from after the trauma narrative exercise to after elevation exercises, whereas nonresponders reported minimal to no changes. Positive responders also demonstrated decreases in cortisol that continued to decline in a delay period, whereas nonresponders demonstrated increases in cortisol. Additional differences were identified regarding history of experiences and dispositional traits.
Limitations: This case series analysis is limited to four participants and does not include a control condition, which limits causal claims. These findings also represent experiences in a controlled laboratory setting; thus, it is unclear if they generalize to daily life for veterans with PTSD.
Conclusions: Future work is needed to expand our understanding of whether higher levels of state elevation contribute to changes in biopsychosocial outcomes, and to determine individual factors that indicate who might benefit from elevation-based interventions.},

	abstract = {Given the risk for veterans with PTSD and moral injury to experience negative social consequences, researchers have increasingly focused on social functioning assessment; however, one gap is the lack of observer-rated assessment and reliance on self-report measures. To better understand the dynamic process of social functioning and how it is affected by PTSD and moral injury distress, it is important to gain perspective on how others perceive those veterans and their interactions. Interpersonal circumplex assessments, such as the Impact Message Inventory-Circumplex (IMI-C), may provide that perspective by asking others to rate observations of veterans’ social behaviors, which is scored in a circular pattern of eight octants representing unique blends of two orthogonal dimensions: affiliation (cold-warm) and control (dominant-submissive). This study demonstrated how the IMI-C can be used to examine significant others’ perceptions of veterans with PTSD and moral injury at baseline (n = 23), prior to a novel positive psychology treatment that focused on inducing moral elevation and its benefits. Using this fine-grained analysis of interpersonal behaviors, this study also described two case studies of veterans who demonstrated notable pre-post changes in how they were perceived by others, providing contextual information including quantitative changes in PTSD symptoms, moral injury, and quality of life, and qualitative reports of interpersonal changes. Preliminary findings suggest significant others characterized veterans’ impact as mostly warm and neither dominant or submissive at baseline. Case examples also suggest meaningful interpersonal shifts in two veterans who found benefit in the moral elevation-based intervention. Lastly, clinical and research implications are discussed.},

	abstract = {Social isolation is a relevant problem for veterans who are at risk for disengaging from others as a function of transition stress from military life to civilian life, and given high rates of exposure to trauma and psychological distress. Few researchers have examined social isolation in veterans over time, particularly during COVID-19 that led to significant barriers and restrictions on social interactions. The purpose of this longitudinal study was to assess veterans’ experience of social isolation and its mental health and social functioning correlates during a 6-month period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were 188 United States veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, who completed a total of four assessments: one every two months for a total duration of six months. Surveys included measures of global mental health and social functioning as indicated by perceived emotional support, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. Multilevel modeling was used to assess 1) growth models to determine whether social isolation changed over time and the trajectory of that change (i.e., linear or quadratic); and 2) whether social isolation was related to both concurrent and prospective indicators of mental health and social functioning. All analyses included person mean centered and grand mean centered isolation to assess for within-and between-person effects. Veterans reported a quadratic trajectory in social isolation that decreased slightly and stabilized over time. Findings indicate that higher social isolation, at both the within- and between-person level, was negatively associated with concurrent emotional support, mental health, quality of marriage, and couple satisfaction. However, all prospective effects were nonsignificant at the within-person level. Results suggest although isolation may decrease over time, veterans report worse mental health and social functioning during times when they report higher levels of social isolation compared to themselves and others. Future work is needed to determine if interventions can be applied during those times to prevent or target those negative associations.},
